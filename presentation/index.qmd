## Introduction

Urban noise pollution affects public health and quality of life.

In 2011, an estimated one million healthy life years were lost from traffic-related noise in the western Europe alone [@world2011burden].

::: callout-note
## Project objective

Understand the spatial patterns of noise exposure in Madrid.

Identify high and low-noise areas.

:::


This supports future policy on urban noise management.

## Data: Stations & EDA

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
load("slides-data.rda")
p1

p2
```

- 31 Noise stations in Madrid, mostly near central roads
- Target data: Annual average of year 2024 
- EDA reveal higher noise in city center

## Covariates
```{r, fig.height = 7}

## Methods
### Bayesian Geostatistical Model
Let $Y_i$ be the noise observed at locations $i \in \{1, \dotsc, n\}$. The model  we use to predict noise level at unsampled locations is as follow:







::: callout-note
## Model
$$
Y_i \mid \mu_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\sigma^2),
$$

$$
\mu_i = \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{5} \beta_k X_{ik} + S(\mathbf{x_i})
$$

- $\beta_0$ is the intercept,
- $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, $\beta_3$, $\beta_4$ and $\beta_5$ are regression coefficients for the covariates
- $S()$ is a spatial random effect that is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian process with Matérn covariance function. SPDE mesh constructed using `inla.nonconvex.hull()`
:::

## Methods
### Estimation
Model fitting performed using INLA [@rue2009approximate]. 

### Model Performance
Assessed by Root Mean Square Error
$$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2 }$$

### Exceedence Probability
Highlight regions with noise levels exceeding 62 dB and below 56 dB.
Reason for threshold: average of WHO guidline (leisure 70dB & road noise $\approx$ 56 dB) [@world2018environmental; @seto2023conversions; @brink2018conversion]]

```

- **Elevation:** ➕ Likely because Madrid’s urban core is on higher terrain.
- **Distance to secondary roads:** ➖ noise decreases further from roads.
- **RMSE:** 3.18 dB ("moderate" performance)

## Prediction
```{r, fig.height=7}
#| layout-ncol: 2
p6

p7
```

## Exceedence Probability

```{r, fig.height=6}
#| layout-ncol: 2
p8

p9
```

- Central districts exhibit highest noise intensity
- Quiet zones are rare, mostly northwest vegetated regions



## Conclusion
- Negative relationship between noise and distance from secondary roads
- Positive relationship with elevation
- Central cities exhibit highest noise intensity
- Quiet zones are rare

<br> 

### Limitations
- Noise stations biased toward roads & urban centers → quieter areas underrepresented
- Dynamic factors missing: traffic volume, land use, building morphology
- Matérn spatial effect assumes isotropy → same distance ≠ same noise in different contexts
